Useful JavaScript Map methods

    clear() – removes all elements from the map object.
    delete(key) – removes an element specified by the key. It returns if the element is in the map, or false if it does not.
    entries() – returns a new Iterator object that contains an array of [key, value] for each element in the map object. The order of objects in the map is the same as the insertion order.
    forEach(callback[, thisArg]) – invokes a callback for each key-value pair in the map in the insertion order. The optional thisArg parameter sets the this value for each callback.
    get(key) – returns the value associated with the key. If the key does not exist, it returns undefined.
    has(key) – returns true if a value associated with the key exists or false otherwise.
    keys() – returns a new Iterator that contains the keys for elements in insertion order.
    set(key, value) – sets the value for the key in the map object. It returns the map object itself therefore you can chain this method with other methods.
    values() returns a new iterator object that contains values for each element in insertion order.
